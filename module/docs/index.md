``segmentio``: Native wrapper for the segment.io SDK
=====================================================

The ``forge.segmentio`` namespace allows you to use the segment.io SDK to record analytics data from your applications.

##Using the segmentio module

The module API follows the same conventions as segment.io's native SDK. See
[https://segment.io/libraries/ios](https://segment.io/libraries/ios) for more
information.


##Configuration options

android_writeKey
:	Android segment.io write key (You can find this on your segment.io project settings page)

ios_writeKey
:	iOS segment.io write key (You can find this on your segment.io project settings page)

> ::important:: If you are using the same segment.io project for both Android and iOS you can simply set the keys to be identical to one another
